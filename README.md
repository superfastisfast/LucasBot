# LucasBot

LucasBot is a **TypeScript + [Bun](https://bun.sh)** powered Discord bot that sprinkles a light‑weight yet surprisingly addictive *RPG‑flavoured* progression layer onto your Discord server. It ships with slash‑command mini‑games, XP & gold rewards, user‑driven quests, and handy role utilities – all persisted in **MongoDB Atlas**, so your hard‑earned loot never disappears when the host restarts.

> “A bot that will make you want to watch the globglogabgalab more!” – *original author*

LucasBot was designed for rapid iteration, minimal runtime overhead, and no‑friction deployment. Whether you are looking to gamify a small study group or add depth to a 10 000‑member community, you can spin up the bot in minutes and start earning 📈 XP.

## ✨ Features

| Category           | Command(s)                      | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎲 **Mini‑games**  | `/diceplayer`                   | Competitive dice roll that awards XP & gold to the highest roller. Ties trigger a sudden‑death throw‑off.                       |
| 🗺️ **Quests**     | `/createquest`, `/executequest` | Create narrative quests with branching outcomes. Quests support Markdown in descriptions, optional images, and dynamic rewards. |
| 💬 **Fun**         | `/globglogabgalab`, `/deeznuts` | A single‑slash gateway to everyone’s favourite library creature. Plays a random quote plus an Easter‑egg GIF...  and a command featuring a random deceased meme called "Deez Nuts" |
| 📈 **Progression** | `/xp`, `/award`, `/escapejail` | View personal stats or manually award XP & gold to a user or role. Includes leaderboard auto‑pagination.                        |
| 🛡️ **Roles**      | `/role add/remove/list`         | Self‑assignable roles with optional level requirements and emoji icons.                                                         |
| 🔧 **Utilities**   | `/ping`, `/pong`, `/uptime`     | Latency test, Easter‑egg reply, and how long the bot has been running.                                                          |

All commands leverage Discord’s **interaction** model: autocomplete, context‑aware validation, and helpful ephemeral error messages. New commands automatically appear in the in‑client command list the moment you deploy.

> **Planned mini‑games:** Blackjack, Rock‑Paper‑Scissors, and Trivia (see Roadmap below).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/<your‑org>/LucasBot.git
$ cd LucasBot

# 2. Install dependencies (≈ 1 s ☕) – Bun is blazing‑fast
$ bun install

# 3. Copy & populate environment vars
$ cp .env.example .env
#   BOT_TOKEN          – Discord bot token (from the Developer Portal)
#   MONGO_URI          – MongoDB connection string
#   QUEST_CHANNEL_ID   – Text channel where quest logs are posted
#   DEV_GUILD_ID       – (optional) Single guild to register commands in during dev

# 4. Run in watch‑mode (hot reloads on file change)
$ bun run dev
```

When the bot starts it will:

1. Log in to Discord and print the invite URL in the console.
2. Register slash‑commands *globally* (or to `DEV_GUILD_ID` if set) – propagation takes \~1 h globally, <1 s per guild.
3. Connect to MongoDB and seed an **admin** user document for the bot owner.

Press <kbd>Ctrl +C</kbd> to stop. All in‑memory cooldown timers are persisted before exit.

## 🔧 Configuration Deep‑Dive

| Variable           | Type   | Default             | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BOT_TOKEN`        | string | —                   | Discord bot token – keep it secret!                     |
| `MONGO_URI`        | string | mongodb://localhost | Connection string incl. credentials.                    |
| `QUEST_CHANNEL_ID` | string | —                   | Channel ID where the bot posts quest narratives.        |
| `XP_PER_MESSAGE`   | number | 5                   | Passive XP for each user message (anti‑spam throttled). |
| `GOLD_PER_LEVEL`   | number | 100                 | Gold awarded when a user levels up.                     |
| `ADMIN_ROLE_ID`    | string | —                   | Optional role ID that bypasses quest cooldowns.         |

You can override any env var at runtime: `XP_PER_MESSAGE=2 bun run dev`.

## 🐚 CLI Scripts

```bash
bun run dev          # dev server with watch
bun run build        # transpile to dist/
bun run start        # production mode (uses dist/) – set NODE_ENV=production
bun run lint         # ESLint
bun run test         # Vitest unit tests (≈ 20 ms)
```

## ⛴️ Deployment Recipes

### Fly.io (recommended ‑ free tier)

```bash
fly launch --dockerfile Dockerfile.fly
fly secrets set BOT_TOKEN=… MONGO_URI=… QUEST_CHANNEL_ID=…
fly deploy
```

Fly’s ephemeral VMs spin up in <200 ms, making them perfect for Bun.

### Railway

1. Click **Deploy on Railway** button in the repo.
2. Add the required environment variables.
3. The production image uses `bun run start`.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  lucasbot:
    image: oven/bun:latest
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    working_dir: /app
    command: ["bun","run","start"]
    environment:
      BOT_TOKEN: ${BOT_TOKEN}
      MONGO_URI: ${MONGO_URI}
      QUEST_CHANNEL_ID: ${QUEST_CHANNEL_ID}
```

> **Note:** Bun’s image is \~60 MB – half the size of Node 18‑alpine.

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

* The bot only requests the **applications.commands** and **bot** scopes.
* Required bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Read Message History`, `Add Reactions`, `Use Slash Commands`.
* It does *not* require `Administrator`.
* All database credentials are loaded from environment variables; no secrets in code.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does LucasBot work on self‑hosted Discord forks?**
A: Not officially – only the canonical Discord API is supported.

**Q: Can I run the bot with Node instead of Bun?**
A: Yes! Replace `bun install` with `npm ci` and `bun run` with `npm run`. Cold‑start will be slightly slower.

**Q: Is the database strictly required?**
A: Yes – without MongoDB the bot cannot persist XP or quests. In‑memory fallback is not planned.
